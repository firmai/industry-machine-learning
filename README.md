A curated list of applied machine learning and data science notebooks and libraries accross different industries. The code in this repository is in Python (primarily using jupyter notebooks) unless otherwise stated. The catalogue is inspired by `awesome-machine-learning`. [r/datascienceproject](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascienceproject/) is a subreddit where you can share all your data science projects. 

***Caution:*** This is a work in progress, please contribute, especially if you are a subject expert in any of the industries listed below. If you are a **[**analytical, computational, statistical, quantitive**]** researcher/analyst in field **X** or a field **X** **[**machine learning engineer, data scientist, modeler, programmer**]** then your contribution will be greatly appreciated.   


If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@dereknow](https://twitter.com/dereknow) or on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snowderek/) or get in contact on the website [FirmAI](https://www.firmai.org).
Also, a listed repository should be deprecated if:

* Repository's owner explicitly say that "this library is not maintained".
* Not committed for long time (2~3 years).

</br>

**Help Needed:** If there is any contributors out there willing to help first populate and then maintain a Python analytics section **in any one of the following sub/industries,** please get in contact with me. Also contact me to add **additional industries**.
